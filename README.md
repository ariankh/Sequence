# DNA Editor

This project implements an advanced DNA editing tool inspired by Vim keybindings, designed for bioinformaticians and researchers working with genomic data. It provides a powerful command-line interface for DNA sequence manipulation, analysis, and visualization.

## Features

- Vim-like modal editing (Normal, Insert, and Visual modes)
- Advanced DNA manipulation operations (insert, delete, replace, change)
- CRISPR-Cas9 editing simulation with NHEJ
- Transcription and translation functions
- GC content calculation with sliding window analysis
- One-hot encoding for ML applications
- Undo/Redo functionality
- Advanced recombination simulation
- Mutation introduction with various mutation types
- Sequence alignment
- Visualization of GC content
- File I/O for FASTA format
- Sequence annotation
- Mutation analysis
